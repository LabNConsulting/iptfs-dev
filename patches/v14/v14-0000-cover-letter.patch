Subject: [PATCH ipsec-next v14 00/15] Add IP-TFS mode to xfrm

* Summary of Changes:

This patchset adds a new xfrm mode implementing on-demand IP-TFS. IP-TFS
(AggFrag encapsulation) has been standardized in RFC9347.

  Link: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9347.txt

This feature supports demand driven (i.e., non-constant send rate)
IP-TFS to take advantage of the AGGFRAG ESP payload encapsulation. This
payload type supports aggregation and fragmentation of the inner IP
packet stream which in turn yields higher small-packet bandwidth as well
as reducing MTU/PMTU issues. Congestion control is unimplementated as
the send rate is demand driven rather than constant.

In order to allow loading this fucntionality as a module a set of
callbacks xfrm_mode_cbs has been added to xfrm as well.

Patchset Structure:
-------------------

The first 5 commits are changes to the net and xfrm infrastructure to
support the callbacks as well as more generic IP-TFS additions that
may be used outside the actual IP-TFS implementation.

  - xfrm: config: add CONFIG_XFRM_IPTFS
  - include: uapi: protocol number and packet structs for AGGFRAG in ESP
  - xfrm: netlink: add config (netlink) options
  - xfrm: add mode_cbs module functionality
  - xfrm: add generic iptfs defines and functionality

The last 10 commits constitute the IP-TFS implementation constructed in
layers to make review easier. The first 9 commits all apply to a single
file `net/xfrm/xfrm_iptfs.c`, the last commit adds a new tracepoint
header file along with the use of these new tracepoint calls.

  - xfrm: iptfs: add new iptfs xfrm mode impl
  - xfrm: iptfs: add user packet (tunnel ingress) handling
  - xfrm: iptfs: share page fragments of inner packets
  - xfrm: iptfs: add fragmenting of larger than MTU user packets
  - xfrm: iptfs: add basic receive packet (tunnel egress) handling
  - xfrm: iptfs: handle received fragmented inner packets
  - xfrm: iptfs: add reusing received skb for the tunnel egress packet
  - xfrm: iptfs: add skb-fragment sharing code
  - xfrm: iptfs: handle reordering of received packets
  - xfrm: iptfs: add tracepoint functionality

Patchset History:
-----------------

v13->v14 (11/14/2024)
  - Fix fix m68k unused function build warning from kernel test robot

v12->v13 (11/5/2024)
  - rebase on updated ipsec-next
  - remove non-standard WARN_ON usages
  - remove non-standard (void) prefix use which indicated ignored return value.
  - move 2 structure fields to compact in-core layout
  - refactor loop out of iptfs_input_ordered() to improve code readability
  - a few format cleanup changes.

v11->v12 (9/14/2024)
  - fix for SA migration, dont alloc over top of newly cloned data 

v10->v11 (9/6/2024)
  - fix double init when xfrm_migrate_state (clone) is called.
  - rename create_state, clone, and delete_state callbacks to
    init_state, clone_state, and destroy_state.
  - skb_orphan skbs prior to aggregation

v9->v10 (8/23/2024)
  - use relocated skb_copy_seq_read now in skbuff.[ch]
  - be thoughtful about skb reserve space in new skbs, use existing #defines and
    skb meta-data to calculate new skb reserve and alignment.
  - only copy dst (on in/out) and dev, ext (on resume input) values from
    existing skb header to new skb's -- drop use of rejected new
    ___copy_skb_header() function.
  - update other iptfs specific skb function names

v8->v9 (8/7/2024)
  - factor common code from skbuff.c:__copy_skb_header into
    ___copy_skb_header and use in iptfs rather that copying any code.
  - change all BUG_ON to WARN_ON_ONCE
  - remove unwanted new NOSKB xfrm MIB error counter
  - remove unneeded copy or share choice function
  - ifdef CONFIG_IPV6 around IPv6 function

v7->v8 (8/4/2024)
  - Use lock and rcu to load iptfs module -- copy existing use pattern
  - fix 2 warnings from the kernel bot

v6->v7 (8/1/2024)
  - Rebased on latest ipsec-next

v5->v6 (7/31/2024)
  * sysctl: removed IPTFS sysctl additions
  - xfrm: use array of pointers vs structs for mode callbacks
  - iptfs: eliminate a memleak during state alloc failure
  - iptfs: free send queue content on SA delete
  - add some kdoc and comments
  - cleanup a couple formatting choices per Steffen

v4->v5 (7/14/2024)
  - uapi: add units to doc comments
  - iptfs: add MODULE_DESCRIPTION()
  - squash nl-direction-update commit

v2->v4 (6/17/2024)

  - iptfs: copy only the netlink attributes to user based on the
    direction of the SA.

  - xfrm: stats: in the output path check for skb->dev == NULL prior to
    setting xfrm statistics on dev_net(skb->dev) as skb->dev may be NULL
    for locally generated packets.

  - xfrm: stats: fix an input use case where dev_net(skb->dev) is used
    to inc stats after skb is possibly NULL'd earlier. Switch to using
    existing saved `net` pointer.

v2->v3
  - Git User Glitch

v1 -> v2 (5/19/2024)

  Updates based on feedback from Sabrina Dubroca, Simon Horman, Antony.

  o Add handling of new netlink SA direction attribute (Antony).
  o Split single patch/commit of xfrm_iptfs.c (the actual IP-TFS impl)
    into 9+1 distinct layered functionality commits for aiding review.
  - xfrm: fix return check on clone() callback
  - xfrm: add sa_len() callback in xfrm_mode_cbs for copy to user
  - iptfs: remove unneeded skb free count variable
  - iptfs: remove unused variable and "breadcrumb" for future code.
  - iptfs: use do_div() to avoid "__udivd13 missing" link failure.
  - iptfs: remove some BUG_ON() assertions questioned in review.

RFCv2 -> v1 (2/19/2024)

  Updates based on feedback from Sabrina Dubroca, kernel test robot

RFCv1 -> RFCv2 (11/12/2023)

  Updates based on feedback from Simon Horman, Antony,
  Michael Richardson, and kernel test robot.

RFCv1 (11/10/2023)
