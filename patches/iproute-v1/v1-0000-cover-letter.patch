Subject: [PATCH iproute-next v1 0/2] Add support for xfrm state direction attribute

Summary of Changes:

  This patchset adds support for setting the new xfrm state direction
  attribute.

  The change also takes into account the existing "offload" direction
  atttribute. If the user is already setting the direction when
  enabling offload then that direciton value is used, and the general
  "dir in|out" need not additionally be specified.

  This work was started based on an earlier patch from
  "Antony Antony" <antony.antony@secunet.com>
