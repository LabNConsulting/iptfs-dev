+	  Information on the IP-TFS/AGGFRAG encapsulation can be found
+	  in RFC 9347. This feature supports demand driven (i.e.,
+	  non-constant send rate) IP-TFS to take advantage of the
+	  AGGFRAG ESP payload encapsulation. This payload type
+	  supports aggregation and fragmentation of the inner IP
+	  packet stream which in turn yields higher small-packet
+	  bandwidth as well as reducing MTU/PMTU issues. Congestion
+	  control is unimplementated as the send rate is demand driven
+	  rather than constant.
