Subject: [PATCH ipsec-next v1 0/8] Add IP-TFS mode to xfrm

This patchset adds a new xfrm mode implementing on-demand IP-TFS. IP-TFS
(AggFrag encapsulation) has been standardized in RFC9347.

Link: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9347.txt

This feature supports demand driven (i.e., non-constant send rate) IP-TFS to
take advantage of the AGGFRAG ESP payload encapsulation. This payload type
supports aggregation and fragmentation of the inner IP packet stream which in
turn yields higher small-packet bandwidth as well as reducing MTU/PMTU issues.
Congestion control is unimplementated as the send rate is demand driven rather
than constant.

In order to allow loading this fucntionality as a module a set of callbacks
xfrm_mode_cbs has been added to xfrm as well.
