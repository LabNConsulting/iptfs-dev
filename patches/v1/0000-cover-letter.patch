Subject: [RFC ipsec-next] Add IP-TFS mode to xfrm

This patchset adds a new xfrm mode implementing on-demand IP-TFS. IP-TFS
(AggFrag encapsulation) has been standardized in RFC9347.

Link: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9347.txt

In order to allow loading this fucntionality as a module a set of callbacks
xfrm_mode_cbs has been added to xfrm as well.
